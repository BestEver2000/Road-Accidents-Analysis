## Analysis and Insights

### 1. Overview of Accident Frequency
- Friday experiences the highest number of accidents (2041), whereas Sunday records the lowest number of accidents (1467).

- The highest number of accidents occurs between 17:00 and 17:59.

___
### 2. Key Locations of Accidents

- __More than 50% of the accidents occur in just three types of locations: office areas, residential areas, and church areas.__

- __Market areas have the highest average casualties (1.76), suggesting higher risks due to congestion or increased activity levels.__

___
### 3. Junction Types and Risks

- __Just three junction types—Crossing, No Junction, and Y-Shape Junction—contribute to approximately 75% of the total accidents.__

- __No junctions and Y-shaped junctions account for the highest number of accidents and casualties, while O-shaped and T-shaped junctions have relatively fewer accidents and a lower percentage of casualties involving more than one person.__

___
### 4. Road Types and Safety

- __Two-way (divided with broken lines) has a much higher accident frequency (35.82%) compared to two-way (divided with solid lines), which has a significantly lower accident rate (1.15%), suggesting that broken line roads are riskier and potentially less safe.__

___
### 5. Causes of Accidents

- __Changing Lane, No distancing, Driving carelessly, No priority to vehicle and Moving Backward are the major reasons for accidents.__

![Description of the image](acc_cause.png)

- __Changing lanes is the leading cause of accidents in all three major areas where the majority of accidents occur.__

___
### 6. Vehicle-Specific Observations

- __Turbo vehicles have the highest percentage of accidents involving more than one death, despite having relatively few overall cases. On the other hand, public vehicles with more than 45 seats show the lowest percentage of such severe accidents, which is unexpectedly low.__
  
___
### 7. Weather Conditions and Risks

- __Snowy conditions pose the highest risk for accidents with multiple casualties, despite having fewer total accidents.__
